# Setup

Clone down this [express-boiler](https://github.com/WDI-DTLA-41/express-boilerplate) plate to get your project started.

# Workflow

Since you'll be part of an organzation, you don't need to fork the project.
Just work off of feature branch.

```
$ git checkout -b my-feature
```

Push your code to your remote feature branch 

```
$ git push origin my-feature
```

[File a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

The scrummaster will be responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests
